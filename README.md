#How to Run

Create a folder for the project.

Inside this folder, create three files: index.html, styles.css, and script.js.

Copy the corresponding code into each file.

Open index.html in a web browser to use the application.

This code provides a basic interface for users to input values for voltage, current, resistance, and power, and calculates the remaining values based on the provided inputs using Ohm's law and power formulas.
